Known Problems
==================

* :index:`HDF5 links` are not handled properly.

  Additional code will be necessary to identify linked items
  and structures will be needed to establish/preserve this
  information within IgorPro.  Notably, linked datasets
  will be replicated while linked groups will be empty on
  reading into IgorPro.  How external file links are handled
  is not known at this time but likely, datasets will be 
  replicated, groups will not, and the association with the
  external file willl not be preserved.  The HDF5 XOP has 
  capabilities to write all these structures so it is likely
  to provide a scheme to write links, once a scheme is devised
  to describe this within IgorPro.
